      <p><ins>Agile and its most popular incarnation Scrum are strangling the joy out of software development as a career. Your company might have adopted it with the best of intentions, but that's not enough. Please consider retiring it and streamlining your processes and tools. Everyone involved will be happier for it.</ins></p>

I'd pay any price, go to any lengths, because my cause was righteous. My intentions were good. In the beginning, that seemed like enough."</em></ins></p></blockquote>
